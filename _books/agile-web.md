While I learned Ruby with [\_why's book][1], I've actually learned [Rails][2] reading the first edition of this book back in 2005. Since then I've read some of the following editions, and they've always been a great way to get a good idea of how to build a web application. I'd say that it's a great option for any newcomer to Rails that enjoy books rather than online tutorials.
