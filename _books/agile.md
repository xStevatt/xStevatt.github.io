This book explains all the main concepts behind agile and try to stay out of the hype. It's refreshing to see a book not treating agile like the perfect solution to everything, and it's a good reference to check for terms and ideas. However,  I didn't really learn anything new. I still think that it's a good starter book for someone not familiar with agile, or a nice way to refresh one's memory.
