I was a big fan of the [OkCupid data blog][1] so I was happy to get a hold of this book, which is basically a longer and printed version of the blog. In it, the author analyses huge datasets about online dating in a funny yet interesting way. The writting is surprisingly good, and the information is neatly presented.
