In this book Kevin Mitnick mostly talks about [Social Engineering][1] meaning the way to manipulate people in order to gain access to classified information. There are a lot of examples and short stories on the subject, and they were interesting... however, I really didn't like the style in which they were written and this made reading the book a bit hard. I feel like it's a great book to discover the social aspects of information security, but if you are already aware of it like I was, a lot of it will seem obvious and you'll find yourself skipping a lot of paragraphs.
