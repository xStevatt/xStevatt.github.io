Every since [I've moved to management][1] I've been listening to the [Manager Tools Podcast][2] which is full of great discussions and insights. When I discovered that there were a book compiling a lot of these insights, I was more than happy to buy it. As expected, it is filled with great ideas focused around 4 themes: one on ones, giving feedbacks, coaching and delegating. Of course it's not just ideas, but also clear advices on how to implement them.
