[Elixir][1] is a very interesting and inovative new language, and this books is the perfect way to learn it. [Dave Thomas][2] does a fantastic job getting you to write code quickly and understand concepts that can be hard to grasp coming from an object oriented background.  Overall, even if you don't want to be writting Elixir most of your time, this book is a great way to understand functionnal programming concepts as well as distributed systems.
