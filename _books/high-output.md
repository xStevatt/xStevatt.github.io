I picked this book because it was referenced a lot in anything related to the [OKR system][1], widely used by Google for instance. It's a great ressource for managers, sometimes stating the obvious, but often giving more insights. It helped me to step back and better understand the bigger picture of what it means to manage a team. Some quotes are very memorable, such as “Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best” or “Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effective by doing and doing visibly”.
