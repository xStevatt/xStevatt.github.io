The back cover of this books features an absolutely dithyrambic review from [Joel Spolsky][1], so I knew it would be worth a read... and it didn't disapoint! It's really a must read for anyone working in software development. From the title, it seems aimed at managers, but really everybody would benefit from it as it's more about interactions between people inside a company. Of course, like any books about humans, nothing is to be taken at face value and there are some generalizations I didn't agree with, but overall the content is well written and insightful.
