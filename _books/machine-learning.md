This interesting book takes an "action oriented" approach to machine learning. It gives a lot of examples and gets you writing code quickly with [R][1]. It also doesn't get too mathematical on the reader. Overall I enjoyed it as a good introduction to machine learning, but it's probably a bit too simplified for any hardcore data scientist.
