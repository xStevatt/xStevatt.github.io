I don't read a lot of marketing books, but I enjoyed this one. In it, [Seth Godin][1] explains how storytelling and the general experience are crucial to sell a product. The book, through a huge number of detailed examples, makes you think about why you're buying a brand instead of another. I didn't have any eye opening moment reading, but it was a very well presented piece on the subject.
