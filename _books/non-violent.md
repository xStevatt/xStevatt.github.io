After hearing a lot about [nonviolent communication][1], I decided to give this reference book a read. It has some interesting points and focuses a lot on empathy which is always a good thing in my opinion. There are a lot of precise examples from the author's experience and everything is generally well written. However the directions given on how to talk to other people seem very contrived and I can't see myself realistically using this mode of communication. Overall, while I liked and agreed with the general ideas mentioned in the book, I'm still not convinced by the whole approach.
