This book from 1987 talking about software could feel old and outdated, but it's really not the case: a lot of ideas and concepts hold true even today. This book focuses on the human side of software development, and this quote sums the situation up perfectly: "The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature". Overall I didn't learn something amazingly new reading this book, but it was a very interesting perspective with some ideas worth reading again.
