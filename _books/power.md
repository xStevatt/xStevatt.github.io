I've always wondered about books like Sun Tzu's "[The Art Of War][1]" or  Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's "[The Prince][2]".  They're often cited as being must read, but I'm not sure I'd be able to go through them... and that's why I picked up this book! In it, the author gives a summary of all the literature on power organized by topics. Each topics is called a "law" and comes with a lot of very interesting short stories from history.  The only problem I had with the book is that it seemed to take the subject almost too seriously and seems aimed at people trying to become president... but taken with some distance it's entertaining and provides good examples.
