This is one of the books I read when I was still somewhat early in my career, and that had a large influence on how I see work and the importance of work / life balance. This book goes hand in hand with the blog [Signal vs Noise][1] and is full of insightful ideas about how people should create products and companies, such as "meetings are toxic", "pick a fight", "planning is guessing", "[fire the workaholics][2]" and so on. Nothing is new, but the book itself takes every idea and push them further. The result is not perfect, but I really enjoyed it. Good points are made and I often find myself quoting it.
