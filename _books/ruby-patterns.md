This one is pretty hard to review: it's design patterns... but in Ruby... and that's pretty much it! Besides the lack of excitement of the subject, the book does the job well of referencing the mostly used patterns, with precise details and schemas. The explainations are not perfect, but again, it's a good reference book.
