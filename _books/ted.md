This book presents ideas to better understand how great public speakers function. It's not a list of tips, but more general concepts and a lot of examples.  While interesting, I didn't feel like I learned a lot. The examples are great and discovering more about the TED story was great, and the book could be worth reading just for that if you are really into learning more about this conference.
