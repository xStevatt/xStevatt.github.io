This books, subtitled "Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business", makes a really good case for building healthy companies. The author explains that a lot of organisations are quite effective at being smart, but often disregard topics like building trust, effective internal communication and other points that would act as a multiplier of intelligence. While some parts of the book might sound obvious, it is still filled with examples taken from the years of experience of the author and is generally a pleasure to read.
