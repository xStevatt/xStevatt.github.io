This one is actually a novel about management, focused on a manufacturing plant in the 1980s. The style is not great, the hero is a bit antipatic to me, but the lessons learned through the book are very interesting. The story format works very well to explain the complex ideas behind the author's  [Theory Of Constraints][1]. It's also surprising to see how some concepts can very much apply to software engineering and operations.
