This is one of those books I heard being referenced countless time before I actually got the chance to pick it up. In it Malcolm Gladwell explains what leads to major changes and how they spread. The main point of this book can be summed up by a quote from the author: "Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do". Overall the book was very well written and based on a lot of great examples.
