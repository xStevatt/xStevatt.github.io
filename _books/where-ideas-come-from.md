I once saw Steven Johnson's [TED talk][1] about the content of this book. I really enjoyed it so I decided to buy it and give it a read... and I was completely disapointed. Some people might enjoy it, but personnally I only saw one concept: "all ideas are derivative". This is great for a talk, but after a few hundred pages of just repeating the same basic idea with different examples I grew tired and gave up.
