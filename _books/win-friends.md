This must be one of the worse title for a book I've ever seen. Actually, only based on this terrible title, I avoided this book and considered it to be a cheesy self help book at best, a pile of ideas to manipulate people at worse.

However, after so many people recommended it to me I ended reading it... and I have to say that it was enlightening. It's true that a lot of the ideas presented are mostly comon sense focused on a strong sense of empathy, but they are presented so clearly that the author makes you really think about the different interactions you can have during a day.
